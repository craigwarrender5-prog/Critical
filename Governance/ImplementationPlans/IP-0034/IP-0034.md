# IP-0034 - DP-0009 - Runtime Logging Hot-Path Remediation

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0009 - Performance & Runtime`
- IP Status: `Draft`
- Scope Basis: Wave 1 performance signal-noise reduction.

## 2) Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0088 | Hot-path simulation code contains runtime logging patterns that can create avoidable overhead. | MEDIUM | READY_FOR_FIX |

## 3) Execution Strategy
1. Stage A profile current logging footprint on hot paths.
2. Stage B define retained diagnostic minimum set and non-hot-path routing.
3. Stage C remove or gate hot-path logging calls.
4. Stage D validate throughput and determinism metrics.
5. Stage E confirm non-regression under system validation workloads.

## 4) Downstream Dependencies Unblocked
- Reduces runtime noise in Stage E runs for `IP-0035`, `IP-0036`, and `IP-0037`.

## 5) Exit Criteria
- No avoidable high-frequency logging in simulation hot paths.
- Performance evidence shows reduced overhead without observability loss.
