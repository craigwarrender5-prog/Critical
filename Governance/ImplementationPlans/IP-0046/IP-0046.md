# IP-0046 - DP-0011 - SG Startup Boundary and Pressure Response Rescheduled Execution

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0011 - Steam Generator Secondary Physics`
- IP Status: `EXECUTED - CLOSURE BLOCKED`
- Included CS count: `4`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0115 | Missing condenser + feedwater return module and startup permissive boundary contract (C-9/P-12) for steam-dump integration | CRITICAL | READY (newly assigned; not yet implemented) |
| CS-0082 | SG startup boundary behavior is modeled isolated where references indicate steam-line warmup/open-path behavior. | HIGH | READY (implementation complete; closure pending) |
| CS-0078 | SG secondary pressure response does not begin at RCP circulation onset; rise is delayed until near-boiling | HIGH | BLOCKED (dependent on CS-0115) |
| CS-0057 | SG startup draining contract at ~200F is not wired into runtime execution path | HIGH | READY (implementation complete; closure pending) |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- `CS-0082` is prerequisite for `CS-0078` and `CS-0057`.
- `CS-0115` is prerequisite for resolving the condenser/permissive boundary contract required to unblock `CS-0078`.

### Blocking relationships
- `CS-0082` blocks downstream pressure-response and draining acceptance.
- `CS-0115` blocks `CS-0078` closure until condenser + feedwater return and C-9/P-12 permissive behavior is modeled.
- `CS-0078` should be complete before final validation of `CS-0057` to avoid false positives in startup windows.
- External blocker: startup baseline freeze from `IP-0048` and primary authority freeze from `IP-0045`.

### Shared files/systems
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/SteamGeneratorPhysics.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- SG startup boundary-state and pressure-response pathways.

### Interference risk between fixes
- High interference risk if startup thermal authority or baseline timing changes during SG remediation.
- Moderate risk of masking defects if draining contract is wired before boundary model correction.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. Implement and validate `CS-0082`.
2. Implement and validate `CS-0115`.
3. Implement and validate `CS-0078`.
4. Implement and validate `CS-0057`.

Critical path: `CS-0082 -> CS-0115 -> CS-0078 -> CS-0057`

## 5) Cross-Domain Notes
- Domain owner remains `DP-0011`.
- Any required runtime interactions with `DP-0001`, `DP-0006`, or `DP-0012` must use explicit Cross-Domain Inclusion Request records.

## 6) Execution Outcome Summary
- `CS-0082`: PASS in Stage D/E evidence. SG startup boundary remained open (`OPEN/ISOLATED samples = 7202/0`).
- `CS-0057`: PASS in Stage D/E evidence. SG draining trigger fired at startup threshold (`T_rcs >= 200F`).
- `CS-0078`: FAIL in Stage D/E evidence. SG pressure remained floor-dominant for most warmup and reverted to floor after a short inventory-derived window.
- `CS-0115`: READY (assigned after Stage E closure recommendation) and defines missing condenser + feedwater return/permissive boundary contract required to unblock `CS-0078`.
- Additional validation blocker resolved during execution: PBOC contract runtime failure caused by Regime 2/Regime 3 control-flow branch coupling.

## 7) Revision History
| Revision | Date | Author | Summary of Changes | Reason for Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Initial successor plan draft from rescheduled IP-0037 scope. | Prepare executable DP-0011 plan with explicit dependency hierarchy and critical path. |
| v1.0 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Executed Stage A-E workflow, implemented CS-0082 and CS-0057 runtime remediation, resolved validation runtime blocker, and generated closure recommendation package. | Record execution evidence and explicit closure-blocked disposition while CS-0078 validation remains unresolved. |
| v1.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Added `CS-0115` (condenser + feedwater return and C-9/P-12 permissive boundary contract) to IP scope and updated dependency chain. | Align active blocker scope to unblock `CS-0078` under the same open IP. |
