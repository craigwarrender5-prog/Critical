# IP-0046 - DP-0011 - SG Startup Boundary and Pressure Response Rescheduled Execution

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0011 - Steam Generator Secondary Physics`
- IP Status: `Draft`
- Included CS count: `3`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0082 | SG startup boundary behavior is modeled isolated where references indicate steam-line warmup/open-path behavior. | HIGH | READY |
| CS-0078 | SG secondary pressure response does not begin at RCP circulation onset; rise is delayed until near-boiling | HIGH | READY |
| CS-0057 | SG startup draining contract at ~200F is not wired into runtime execution path | HIGH | READY |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- `CS-0082` is prerequisite for `CS-0078` and `CS-0057`.

### Blocking relationships
- `CS-0082` blocks downstream pressure-response and draining acceptance.
- `CS-0078` should be complete before final validation of `CS-0057` to avoid false positives in startup windows.
- External blocker: startup baseline freeze from `IP-0048` and primary authority freeze from `IP-0045`.

### Shared files/systems
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/SteamGeneratorPhysics.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- SG startup boundary-state and pressure-response pathways.

### Interference risk between fixes
- High interference risk if startup thermal authority or baseline timing changes during SG remediation.
- Moderate risk of masking defects if draining contract is wired before boundary model correction.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. Implement and validate `CS-0082`.
2. Implement and validate `CS-0078`.
3. Implement and validate `CS-0057`.

Critical path: `CS-0082 -> CS-0078 -> CS-0057`

## 5) Cross-Domain Notes
- Domain owner remains `DP-0011`.
- Any required runtime interactions with `DP-0001`, `DP-0006`, or `DP-0012` must use explicit Cross-Domain Inclusion Request records.

## 6) Revision History
| Revision | Date | Author | Summary of Changes | Reason for Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Initial successor plan draft from rescheduled IP-0037 scope. | Prepare executable DP-0011 plan with explicit dependency hierarchy and critical path. |
