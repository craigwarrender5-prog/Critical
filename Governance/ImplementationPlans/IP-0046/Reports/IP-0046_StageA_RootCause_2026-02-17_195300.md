# IP-0046 Stage A Root Cause Confirmation (2026-02-17_195300)

- IP: `IP-0046`
- DP: `DP-0011`
- Stage: `A`

## 1) Scope Confirmation
Stage A scope is limited to:
1. `CS-0082` - startup SG boundary isolation mismatch.
2. `CS-0078` - delayed SG secondary pressure response at startup.
3. `CS-0057` - missing SG draining trigger wiring at `~200F`.

Scope source:
- `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json`
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/IP-0046/IP-0046.md`

## 2) Root-Cause Baseline
1. `CS-0082` baseline mismatch is in startup boundary authority policy:
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:3086`
2. `CS-0057` baseline gap is absence of runtime trigger invocation before this execution cycle:
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:1513`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:3066`
3. `CS-0078` baseline behavior requires runtime evidence from startup logs and pressure-source transitions:
- `Build/HeatupLogs/...` historical artifacts in register evidence
- new execution evidence generated under `HeatupLogs/IP-0046_StageD_20260217_195532`

## 3) Additional Validation Blocker Identified
During Stage D trial execution, a runtime blocker was discovered:
- `InvalidOperationException` in PBOC contract guard:
  - `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.CVCS.cs:185`
- Trigger condition was Regime 2/Regime 3 branch control-flow coupling during startup progression:
  - `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:1724`
  - `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:1937`

This blocker is not a new CS in IP-0046 scope, but had to be remediated to execute Stage D/E runtime validation.

## 4) Stage A Exit Decision
Stage A root-cause confirmation is complete for scoped CS items and the runtime validation blocker.
Stage B design freeze authorized.
