# IP-0049 - DP-0013 - Validation Scenario Integration Bridge

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0013 - Validation & Diagnostics`
- IP Status: `Draft`
- Included CS count: `1`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0104 | Wrap existing validation runner as selectable Validation Scenario | HIGH | READY |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- Within-domain prerequisite list is empty (single CS scope).

### Blocking relationships
- External blocker: `DP-0008` scenario abstraction/registry and selection entrypoints must be available before full execution.
- If `DP-0008` work is not available, this IP remains staged at design/integration preparation only.

### Shared files/systems
- Validation runner entrypoints in `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- Scenario launch lifecycle contracts owned in `DP-0008`

### Interference risk between fixes
- High cross-domain integration risk because this CS requires DP-0008-owned scenario interfaces.
- Regression risk if wrapper alters existing validation semantics.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. Confirm DP-0008 scenario interfaces and inclusion approval.
2. Implement and validate `CS-0104`.

Critical path: `DP-0008 interface readiness -> CS-0104`

## 5) Cross-Domain Inclusion Protocol
- Mandatory Cross-Domain Inclusion Request required before implementation work touches DP-0008-owned surfaces.
- Approval artifact must identify minimal integration scope and validation implications.

## 6) Revision History
| Revision | Date | Author | Summary of Changes | Reason for Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Initial DP-0013 implementation plan draft for validation scenario bridge. | Prepare execution plan with explicit cross-domain blocking and protocol requirements. |
