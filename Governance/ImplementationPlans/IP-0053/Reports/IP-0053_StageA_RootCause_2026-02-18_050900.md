# IP-0053 Stage A Root Cause (2026-02-18 05:09 UTC)

- IP: `IP-0053`
- Stage: `A - Root Cause`
- Result: `PASS`

## Findings
1. `CS-0102`: Scenario framework existed but closure gap remained in DP ownership semantics and bootstrap extensibility.
2. `CS-0103` and `CS-0120`: `F2` selector flow was validator-only; operator-view `F2` path was missing.
3. `CS-0121`: Overview state LED logic did not light for solid PZR state, and dashboard header alarm marker used mojibake text.

## Stage Decision
- Proceed to Stage B with explicit DP-0008 ownership freeze and async-safe input-routing design.
