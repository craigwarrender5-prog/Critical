# IP-0051: PZR Temperature Visualization Enhancement

**Version:** v1.2  
**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Domain Plan:** DP-0008 - Operator Interface & Scenarios  
**Status:** CLOSED  
**Changelog:** `Governance/Changelogs/CHANGELOG_v1.1.1.0.md`  
**Closeout Report:** `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0051/Reports/IP-0051_Closeout_Traceability.md`

## 1. Problem Summary

IP-0051 addressed operator visibility gaps for pressurizer temperature monitoring during cold startup.
The delivered scope improved PZR temperature observability for bubble-formation readiness without changing physics behavior.

## 2. Included CS Items

| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| CS-0108 | PZR temperature monitoring missing for bubble formation readiness during cold startup | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0111 | PZR temperature (T_pzr) lacks primary visualization - no arc gauge or trend display | MEDIUM | CLOSED |

---

## 3. Delivered Scope

1. Added T_pzr arc gauge in the Pressurizer column.
2. Removed misplaced T_pzr readout from RCS column.
3. Added T_pzr trend sparkline (replacing NET HEAT slot usage).

All changes were display-layer only and non-physics.
