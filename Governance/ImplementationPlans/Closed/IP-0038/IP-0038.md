# IP-0038 - DP-0010 - Governance Hardening and GOLD Compliance Closeout

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0010 - Project Governance`
- IP Status: `RESCHEDULED`
- Scope Basis: Wave 4 governance hardening after behavior-changing IPs stabilize.

## 2) Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0099 | Governance Hardening v3 – Mandatory CS Lifecycle, Persistent Domain Model, Dependency Hierarchy Enforcement, Cross-Domain Protocol, CS Persistence Rule, and IP Revision Control | CRITICAL | READY |
| CS-0063 | Simulation-facing files exceed GOLD hard size limits without documented waiver | MEDIUM | READY |
| CS-0070 | HeatupSimEngine header lacks mandatory GOLD C01 sections (SOURCES and UNITS) | LOW | READY |
| CS-0084 | Project-owned C# files do not uniformly meet required GOLD header metadata fields. | HIGH | READY |
| CS-0085 | File-level change history is incomplete or missing for audited modules. | MEDIUM | READY |
| CS-0086 | Public API surfaces lack consistent XML documentation coverage. | MEDIUM | READY |
| CS-0087 | Several modules exceed responsible file-size/separation-of-concerns limits, increasing coupling risk. | MEDIUM | READY |
| CS-0089 | Validation modules remain in global namespace, conflicting with namespace-folder convention standardization. | MEDIUM | READY |
| CS-0090 | Project-level changelog governance is missing, weakening traceability for module changes and deviations. | HIGH | READY |

## 3) Intra-IP Sequencing
1. Constitutional/governance hardening baseline: CS-0099.
2. Policy and metadata baselines: CS-0070, CS-0084, CS-0085, CS-0090.
3. API and namespace standardization: CS-0086, CS-0089.
4. Structural hardening: CS-0063, CS-0087.

## 4) External Dependencies
- Follows `IP-0032` governance preconditions.
- Deferred to last wave to minimize churn while physics/behavior IPs are active.
- `CS-0100` remains `INVESTIGATING` and is excluded from this IP until investigation completion and transition to `READY`.

## 5) Stage Gates
- Stage A: audit and baseline capture.
- Stage B: compliance target definitions and waiver policy.
- Stage C: controlled governance remediations.
- Stage D: compliance validation against GOLD and project standards.
- Stage E: regression/packaging checks and closure preparation.

## 6) Exit Criteria
- In-scope governance compliance criteria pass.
- Documentation, namespace, and changelog governance are in a maintainable steady state.
- Structural remediation items are either closed or formally waived with evidence.
