# IP-0054 - DP-0001 - No-RCP Thermal Coupling Fidelity

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0001 - Primary Thermodynamics`
- IP Status: `CLOSED`
- Included CS count: `1`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CS-0122` | RCS temperature incorrectly rising during solid PZR heatup with no RCP flow | HIGH | CLOSED |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- None declared in-register.

### Blocking relationships
- This IP establishes the no-RCP thermal-coupling baseline used by downstream startup-policy validation in `IP-0052`.

### Shared files/systems
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/SolidPlantPressure.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/HeatTransfer.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/LoopThermodynamics.cs`

### Interference risk between fixes
- High risk if no-RCP coupling floor changes are made without preserving RCP-on behavior and RHR thermal path stability.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. Stage A: freeze current no-RCP coupling behavior and acceptance envelope.
2. Stage B: design corrected no-RCP transport policy (remove unconditional over-coupling).
3. Stage C: implement thermal-coupling gating and parameter updates.
4. Stage D: validate no-RCP and RCP-on thermal trajectories.
5. Stage E: regression across startup transitions and pressure-control interactions.

Critical path:
`No-RCP baseline capture -> coupling policy correction -> thermal trajectory validation -> regression`

## 5) Enforcement Gates and Exit Criteria
### Gate A - Baseline Capture PASS
- Existing no-RCP thermal trajectory is captured with reproducible evidence.
- Acceptance envelope for corrected no-RCP behavior is numerically defined.

### Gate B - Coupling Policy Implementation PASS
- No-RCP transport no longer relies on unconditional minimum coupling that over-drives RCS bulk heating.
- RCP-on coupling path remains intact and deterministic.

### Gate C - Domain Validation PASS
- With `RCPs OFF`, RCS bulk temperature no longer exhibits spurious rise from PZR heater activity beyond defined envelope.
- With `RCPs ON`, expected forced-coupling behavior remains valid.

### Gate D - System Regression PASS
- No regressions in solid-plant pressure behavior, RHR path, or startup sequence transitions.

### IP Closeout PASS
- Stage evidence recorded for A-D gates.
- `CS-0122` closure disposition is traceable and complete.

## 6) Cross-Domain Notes
- Domain owner remains `DP-0001`.
- Completion is prioritized before `IP-0052` closure validation to avoid startup-policy tuning against a distorted no-RCP thermal baseline.

## 7) Revision History
| Revision | Date | Author | Summary of Changes | Reason for Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-18 | Codex | Initial DP-0001 implementation plan for CS-0122 corrective scope. | Convert new high-severity thermal-fidelity investigation into executable governance plan. |
| v0.2 | 2026-02-18 | Codex | Executed core Stage C remediation: removed unconditional no-RCP bulk-coupling floor in `HeatupSimEngine` transport-factor policy; validated compile with `dotnet build Critical.slnx` (0 errors). | Begin IP execution with code-level correction for CS-0122 root cause and objective build evidence. |
| v0.3 | 2026-02-18 | Codex | Executed Stage D/E validation using deterministic Unity batch evidence (`IP0054ValidationRunner`) and confirmed no-RCP envelope + RCP-on non-regression gates pass. | Complete technical execution and produce closure-ready governance evidence package. |
| v1.0 | 2026-02-18 | Codex | Executed closure transaction: moved IP to `Closed/`, closed `CS-0122` as `FIXED`, generated closeout traceability/changelog, and finalized governance references. | Complete approved closeout for IP-0054. |

## 8) Execution Update (Completed - Closed)

### Implemented Remediation
- Updated no-RCP transport policy in `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`:
  - Replaced unconditional baseline coupling floor (`0.08`) with `0.0` baseline coupling in no-forced-flow conditions.
  - `ComputeNoRcpBulkTransportFactor()` now returns only forced-flow-derived coupling when RHR transport exists; zero-flow no-RCP state no longer injects mandatory bulk thermal coupling.

### Validation Evidence
- Build validation completed:
  - Command: `dotnet build Critical.slnx`
  - Result: `0` errors (`97` warnings, non-blocking)
- Runtime Stage D evidence captured:
  - `HeatupLogs/IP-0054_StageD_20260218_044748/IP-0054_StageD_Summary.md`
  - No-flow gate: `max|noRcpTransport|=0.000000`, `max|RHR flow|=0.0000 gpm`, `T_rcs slope=-0.424 F/hr`.
  - RCP-on gate: first RCP `t=13.142 hr`, `transport=1.0000`; +30 min `T_rcs rise=+2.926 F`, `heatupRate=+15.485 F/hr`.
  - Regression counters: `RTCC failures=0`, `PBOC pairing failures=0`.

### Closeout Transaction
- Stage D: `PASS` (`Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0054/Reports/IP-0054_StageD_DomainValidation_2026-02-18_045200.md`)
- Stage E: `PASS` (`Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0054/Reports/IP-0054_StageE_SystemRegression_2026-02-18_045300.md`)
- `CS-0122` disposition: `CLOSED (FIXED)` in `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_index.json`; removed from active working set `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json`.
- IP disposition: `CLOSED`.
