# IP-0033 Stage A Root Cause Confirmation (2026-02-16_214500)

## 1) Scope
`IP-0033` Stage A scope (`DP-0007`):
- `CS-0006`
- `CS-0007`
- `CS-0011`
- `CS-0012`
- `CS-0041`
- `CS-0062`
- `CS-0064`

## 2) Baseline and Gate Record
- Baseline rollback anchor commit: `6d6225cddb9f2dc603b9dac61502de060f524f85`
- Baseline commit timestamp: `2026-02-16T21:19:55+01:00`
- Baseline push status: existing branch anchor available before DP-0007 execution.
- Working tree at Stage A start: non-clean (pre-existing unrelated edits preserved):
  - `Governance/DomainPlans/DP-0012 - Pressurizer & Startup Control.md`
  - `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_index.json`
  - `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json`
  - `Governance/Issues/CS-0098_Investigation_Report_2026-02-16_214500.md`

## 3) Evidence Reviewed

### CS-0006 / CS-0007
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.Logging.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupValidationVisual.TabValidation.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.Init.cs`

### CS-0012 / CS-0062
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.Logging.cs`

### CS-0041
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupValidationVisual.Panels.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.Logging.cs`

### CS-0064
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/ScreenDataBridge.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Simulation/Modular/State/PlantState.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Simulation/Modular/State/LegacyStateBridge.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.RuntimePerf.cs`

### CS-0011
- `Assets/Scripts/Tests/AcceptanceTests_v5_4_0.cs`
- `Governance/DomainPlans/Closed/IP-0010 — Test Infrastructure.md`

## 4) Root-Cause Confirmation
- `CS-0006`: diagnostic method existed but was historically dead; current branch already has active call path and initialization reset.
- `CS-0007`: UI drift row was historically absent; current branch already includes validation-row rendering.
- `CS-0012`: physics regime transitions were not explicitly logged despite deterministic regime changes.
- `CS-0062`: Stage E primary heat telemetry source was aliased to SG removal, collapsing over-primary checks.
- `CS-0041`: inventory display mismatch originated from geometric-vs-mass baseline mixing; current branch already converted display path to mass basis.
- `CS-0064`: UI bridge still had direct mutable field reads where snapshot boundary exists.
- `CS-0011`: acceptance suite still allowed vacuous PASS without runtime simulation evidence.

## 5) Dependency Map (Intra-IP)
1. Validate carry-forward remediations (`CS-0006`, `CS-0007`, `CS-0041`).
2. Correct telemetry/logging semantics (`CS-0062`, `CS-0012`).
3. Enforce snapshot boundary reads (`CS-0064`).
4. Finalize runtime-evidence acceptance contract (`CS-0011`).

## 6) Stage A Exit Decision
Stage A root-cause confirmation complete for all scoped CS items. Stage B design freeze authorized.
