# IP-0033 - DP-0007 - Validation and Diagnostics Evidence Foundation

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0007 - Validation & Diagnostics`
- IP Status: `CLOSED`
- Scope Basis: Wave 1 diagnostics foundation and validation signal integrity.
- Sequence intent: make downstream acceptance evidence trustworthy.
- Current stage: `Closed - Approval Recorded`

## 2) Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0006 | UpdatePrimaryMassLedgerDiagnostics() never called (dead code) | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0007 | No UI display for primary ledger drift | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0012 | No regime transition logging | LOW | CLOSED |
| CS-0062 | Stage E primary-heat telemetry is aliased to SG removal, collapsing over-primary validation signal | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0041 | Inventory audit baseline type mismatch (geometric vs mass-derived gallons) | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0064 | Heatup engine state is exposed as ad-hoc mutable public fields without typed snapshot boundary | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0011 | Acceptance tests are formula-only, not simulation-validated | HIGH | CLOSED |

## 3) Intra-IP Sequencing
1. CS-0006 then CS-0007 (hard dependency).
2. CS-0012 and CS-0062 (signal and logging correctness).
3. CS-0041 and CS-0064 (inventory baseline correctness and typed state boundary).
4. CS-0011 (simulation-validated acceptance harness finalization).

## 4) Downstream Dependencies Unblocked
- Improves acceptance confidence for `IP-0035`, `IP-0036`, and `IP-0037`.
- Provides stable telemetry basis for Stage D/E evidence packaging.

## 5) Stage Gates
- Stage A: reproduce missing/aliased diagnostics and test coverage gaps.
- Stage B: freeze metric definitions and typed snapshot/telemetry contracts.
- Stage C: implement diagnostics, telemetry, and test-harness corrections.
- Stage D: validate per-CS acceptance checks.
- Stage E: run cross-domain regression using corrected signals.

## 6) Exit Criteria
- Primary ledger diagnostics run and are visible.
- Regime transitions and primary-heat signals are unambiguous.
- Inventory baseline comparisons use consistent type basis.
- Simulation-validated tests exist for in-scope acceptance.
