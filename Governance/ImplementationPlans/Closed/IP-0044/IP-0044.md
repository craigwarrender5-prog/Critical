## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0006 - Plant Protection & Limits`
- IP Status: `CLOSED`
- Included CS count: `2`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0079 | RCP startup permissive is configured below documented minimum startup pressure requirements. | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0010 | No SG secondary pressure alarm | LOW | CLOSED |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- `CS-0079` is prerequisite for `CS-0010`.

### Blocking relationships
- `CS-0079` blocks final acceptance of `CS-0010` because alarm setpoint validity depends on permissive/pressure contract correctness.
- External blocker `IP-0048` baseline freeze is satisfied.

### Shared files/systems
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/PlantConstants.Pressure.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/RCPSequencer.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/AlarmManager.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.Alarms.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupValidationVisual.Annunciators.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/ValidationDashboard/Panels/OverviewSection_Alarms.cs`

### Interference risk between fixes
- Startup baseline churn risk is retired via closed dependency `IP-0048`.
- No new cross-domain coupling was introduced during IP-0044 execution.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. Validate carry-forward implementation and authority alignment for `CS-0079`.
2. Validate SG alarm path integrity and visibility for `CS-0010`.
3. Execute closure transaction for both CS lifecycle entries.

Critical path: `CS-0079 -> CS-0010`

## 5) Enforcement Stages and Exit Criteria
- Stage A: root-cause confirmation against active register and predecessor evidence.
- Stage B: design/acceptance contract freeze.
- Stage C: controlled remediation execution (no new code delta required).
- Stage D: domain validation and compile check (`dotnet build`, `0` errors).
- Stage E: regression and governance snapshot verification prior to closure.

## 6) Cross-Domain Notes
- Domain ownership remains `DP-0006`.
- No cross-domain inclusion request was required for this closure transaction.

## 7) Revision History
| Revision | Date | Author | Summary of Changes | Reason for Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Initial successor plan draft from rescheduled IP-0035 scope. | Prepare executable DP-0006 plan with constitutional dependency hierarchy and sequencing. |
| v1.0 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Executed Stage A-E validation chain, generated closure artifacts, migrated scoped CS to archive, and finalized closeout traceability package. | Record execution completion and constitutional closure evidence for IP-0044 scope. |
