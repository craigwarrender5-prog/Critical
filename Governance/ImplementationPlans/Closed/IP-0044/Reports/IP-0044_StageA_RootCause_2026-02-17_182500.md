# IP-0044 Stage A Root Cause Confirmation (2026-02-17_182500)

## 1) Scope
`IP-0044` Stage A scope (`DP-0006`):
- `CS-0079`
- `CS-0010`

## 2) Baseline and Dependency Record
- Baseline dependency satisfied: `IP-0048` is closed with frozen startup baseline evidence.
- Active scope source at Stage A start:
  - `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json:8`
  - `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json:26`
- Working tree at Stage A start: non-clean due unrelated parallel workstream files; IP-0044 scope executed without reverting or mutating unrelated tracks.

## 3) Evidence Reviewed
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0035/Reports/IP-0035_StageD_DomainValidation_2026-02-16_224400.md`
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0035/Reports/IP-0035_StageE_SystemRegression_2026-02-16_224900.md`
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0048/Reports/IP-0048_Closeout_Traceability.md`
- `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json:8`
- `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json:26`

## 4) Root-Cause Confirmation
1. `CS-0079` remains a startup permissive contract item: RCP start authority must enforce documented minimum startup pressure (`>= 400 psig`).
2. `CS-0010` remains an annunciation contract item: SG secondary pressure high alarm must exist with deterministic set/clear and operator visibility.
3. Current branch already contains prior remediation in authoritative physics/alarm paths; Stage A confirms no unresolved root-cause drift for either CS.

## 5) Stage A Exit Decision
Stage A root-cause confirmation is complete for `CS-0079` and `CS-0010`. Stage B design freeze authorized.
