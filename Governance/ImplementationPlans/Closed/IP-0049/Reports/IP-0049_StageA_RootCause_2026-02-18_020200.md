# IP-0049 Stage A Root Cause (2026-02-18 02:02 UTC)

- IP: `IP-0049`
- Stage: `A - Root Cause`
- Result: `PASS`

## Findings
1. `CS-0104` root cause confirmed: validation execution had no scenario-selectable boundary.
2. DP-0008 scenario framework surfaces were absent at canonical path `Assets/Scripts/ScenarioSystem/`.
3. Validation semantics must remain unchanged; wrapper must call existing `StartSimulation()` path.

## Evidence
- `Governance/Issues/CS-0104_Investigation_Report_2026-02-17_124730.md`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- `Documentation/PROJECT_TREE.md`

## Stage Decision
- Proceed to Stage B with minimal bridge design.
