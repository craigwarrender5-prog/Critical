# IP-0048 - DP-0012 - Startup Baseline and Heater Release Determinism

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0012 - Pressurizer & Startup Control`
- IP Status: `CLOSED`
- Included CS count: `2`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0101 | Introduce deterministic Cold Shutdown initialization baseline as default startup state | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0098 | Heaters do not start after startup-hold release during cold-start sequence | HIGH | CLOSED |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- `CS-0101` is prerequisite for `CS-0098` final acceptance.

### Blocking relationships
- `CS-0101` blocks reliable verification of `CS-0098` because heater-release behavior depends on known initial baseline state.

### Shared files/systems
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.Init.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- Startup-hold release and heater permissive pathways.

### Interference risk between fixes
- High risk of false-pass/fail outcomes if heater-release fixes are validated before cold-shutdown baseline is deterministic.
- Moderate downstream impact risk on SG and plant-protection startup validation windows.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. Implement and validate `CS-0101`.
2. Implement and validate `CS-0098`.

Critical path: `CS-0101 -> CS-0098`

## 5) Enforcement Gates and Exit Criteria
### Gate A - Cold Shutdown Determinism PASS (`CS-0101`)
- A documented Cold Shutdown parameter table is produced and approved for execution use.
- A startup snapshot artifact is captured from boot-initialized state.
- Re-run reproducibility check passes: 3 consecutive cold boots produce identical baseline state markers within tolerance.
- Initialized pressure/temperature variance remains within defined tolerance across the 3-run set.
- Tolerance must be numeric and pre-declared in the Gate A artifact before running reproducibility checks; qualitative tolerance wording is not acceptable for gate closure.
- Tolerance selection must explicitly allow floating-point rounding noise while still rejecting logic/state drift.
- Evidence artifact required:
  - `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0048/Reports/IP-0048_GateA_ColdShutdownBaseline.md`

### Gate B - Heater Release Determinism PASS (`CS-0098`)
- Logged state transitions confirm:
  - Startup Hold `->` Released
  - Heater permissive `-> TRUE`
  - Heater ramp command `> 0`
- Heater output reaches expected post-release operating window in the validated run set.
- Validation confirms no unintended suppression by pressure-path logic during release sequence.
- Evidence artifact required:
  - `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0048/Reports/IP-0048_GateB_HeaterReleaseValidation.md`

### IP Closeout PASS
- Both gates are `PASS` with linked artifacts and objective measurements.
- CS lifecycle disposition is explicit and traceable for all included CS.

## 6) Cross-Domain Notes
- Domain owner remains `DP-0012`.
- Baseline outputs from this IP are consumed by `IP-0044` and `IP-0046`; those plans should not start Stage D/E until this IP baseline is frozen.
- Closeout artifacts:
  - `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0048/Reports/IP-0048_GateA_ColdShutdownBaseline.md`
  - `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0048/Reports/IP-0048_GateB_HeaterReleaseValidation.md`
  - `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0048/Reports/IP-0048_Closeout_Traceability.md`

## 7) Revision History
| Revision | Date | Author | Summary of Changes | Reason for Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Initial DP-0012 implementation plan draft for active startup-control scope. | Establish deterministic startup baseline and heater-release dependency ordering. |
| v0.2 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Added objective Gate A/Gate B enforcement criteria and required evidence artifacts for startup and heater-release determinism validation. | Ensure deterministic, auditable closeout criteria and prevent subjective closure. |
| v1.0 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Executed CS-0101 and CS-0098, generated Gate A/B evidence, migrated scoped CS to closed archive, and finalized closeout traceability package. | Record execution completion and constitutional closure evidence for IP-0048 scope. |
