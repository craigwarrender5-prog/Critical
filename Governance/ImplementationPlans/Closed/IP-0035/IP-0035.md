# IP-0035 - DP-0006 - Plant Protection Startup Permissive and SG Pressure Alarm Alignment

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0006 - Plant Protection & Limits`
- IP Status: `RESCHEDULED`
- Scope Basis: Wave 2 plant protection alignment after authority preconditions.
- Current stage: `Closed - Rescheduled`

## 2) Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0079 | RCP startup permissive is configured below documented minimum startup pressure requirements. | HIGH | READY |
| CS-0010 | No SG secondary pressure alarm | LOW | READY |

## 3) Intra-IP Sequencing
1. CS-0079 first (startup permissive authority and threshold correctness).
2. CS-0010 second (alarm behavior built on corrected permissive/pressure context).

## 4) External Dependencies
- Depends on `IP-0032` for stable authority baseline and constants governance.
- Should consume diagnostics outputs from `IP-0033` for acceptance evidence.

## 5) Stage Gates
- Stage A: confirm permissive and alarm current failure signatures.
- Stage B: freeze startup pressure threshold and alarm trigger/clear criteria.
- Stage C: remediate permissive and SG alarm behavior.
- Stage D: validate threshold enforcement and alarm response under scenarios.
- Stage E: verify non-regression in full startup sequence.

## 6) Exit Criteria
- RCP startup permissive aligns with documented minimum pressure requirements.
- SG secondary pressure alarm exists and behaves deterministically.
