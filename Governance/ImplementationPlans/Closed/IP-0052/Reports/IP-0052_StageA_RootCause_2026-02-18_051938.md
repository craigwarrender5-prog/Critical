# IP-0052 Stage A - Root Cause and Envelope Freeze (2026-02-18_051938)

- IP: `IP-0052`
- DP: `DP-0012`
- Gate: `A`
- Result: `PASS`

## Root Cause Confirmation
1. Solid pre-heater behavior was constrained by `HEATER_PRESSURIZE` CVCS trim clamp (`+/-1 gpm`) while heater participation was active in early Mode 5.
2. This conflated mechanism ownership (CVCS vs heater) and prevented deterministic policy boundary enforcement for pre-heater stage.

## Frozen Stage A Envelope
1. Pre-heater control mode: `PREHEATER_CVCS` (CVCS-dominant; heater lockout enforced in engine).
2. Pre-heater rate envelope target: `50-100 psi/hr`.
3. Pre-heater policy command envelope (trace target): `+20 to +40 gpm` net charging (tracked as policy telemetry).
4. Deterministic handoff boundary: pressure >= `PlantConstants.PRESSURIZE_COMPLETE_PRESSURE_PSIA` (`334.7 psia`, `320 psig`) for `PlantConstants.PRESSURIZE_STABILITY_TIME_HR` (`300 s`).
