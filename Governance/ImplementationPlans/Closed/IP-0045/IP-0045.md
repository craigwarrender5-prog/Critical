# IP-0045 - DP-0001 - Primary Thermodynamics Rescheduled Authority and Modular RCS Preparation

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0001 - Primary Thermodynamics`
- IP Status: `CLOSED`
- Included CS count: `3`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0080 | RCP heat-input constants do not align with the cited cold-water heatup reference basis. | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0105 | Modularize current single-loop RCS into reusable RCSLoop prefab/module boundary | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0106 | Add RCS loop manager/aggregator supporting N loops with N=1 compatibility | HIGH | CLOSED |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- `CS-0105` is prerequisite for `CS-0106` (loop manager must consume a modular loop boundary).
- `CS-0080` baseline authority must be frozen before final acceptance of `CS-0105` and `CS-0106`.

### Blocking relationships
- `CS-0105` blocks `CS-0106`.
- `CS-0080` blocks closeout acceptance for modularization work due to shared thermal authority surfaces.

### Shared files/systems
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/RCSHeatup.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/LoopThermodynamics.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/ScreenDataBridge.cs`

### Interference risk between fixes
- High coupling risk between authority constants and modular extraction if done out of sequence.
- Moderate regression risk for downstream telemetry consumers when introducing loop-manager aggregation.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. Freeze and remediate `CS-0080`.
2. Implement modular loop boundary for `CS-0105`.
3. Implement loop manager/aggregator for `CS-0106`.

Critical path: `CS-0080 -> CS-0105 -> CS-0106`

## 5) Cross-Domain Notes
- Domain owner remains `DP-0001`.
- No cross-domain inclusion request was required during IP-0045 closeout.

## 6) Enforcement Stages and Exit Criteria
- Stage A: Root-cause confirmation against active register and predecessor closure evidence.
- Stage B: Design and acceptance contract freeze.
- Stage C: Controlled remediation execution for modular loop boundary and manager scaffolding.
- Stage D: Domain validation and compile check (`dotnet build`, `0` errors).
- Stage E: Regression and governance snapshot verification for closure recommendation.

## 7) Revision History
| Revision | Date | Author | Summary of Changes | Reason for Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Initial successor plan draft for DP-0001 active scope. | Prepare executable DP-0001 plan with dependency hierarchy for authority plus modularization work. |
| v1.0 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Executed Stage A-E workflow, implemented modular RCS boundary/manager scaffolding, validated compile success, and produced closure recommendation package. | Record executable completion evidence for IP-0045 pending explicit closure transaction. |
| v1.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Completed closure transaction, migrated scoped CS entries to archive, and finalized closeout traceability. | Record constitutional closeout completion for IP-0045 scope. |
