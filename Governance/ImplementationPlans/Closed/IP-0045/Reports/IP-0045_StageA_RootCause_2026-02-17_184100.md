# IP-0045 Stage A Root Cause Confirmation (2026-02-17_184100)

## 1) Scope
`IP-0045` Stage A scope (`DP-0001`):
- `CS-0080`
- `CS-0105`
- `CS-0106`

## 2) Baseline and Dependency Record
- Baseline dependency satisfied: `IP-0048` startup baseline freeze is closed.
- Active scope source at Stage A start:
  - `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json:8`
  - `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json:338`
  - `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json:381`
- Working tree at Stage A start: non-clean due unrelated parallel workstream files; IP-0045 scope executed without reverting or mutating unrelated tracks.

## 3) Evidence Reviewed

- `Governance/IssueRegister/issue_register.json:381`

## 4) Root-Cause Confirmation
1. `CS-0080` remains an authority-governed thermal baseline contract: RCP heat basis must stay aligned to frozen authority (`~24 MW total`, `~6 MW each`) while modularization proceeds.
2. `CS-0105` remains a structural modularization requirement: current single-loop behavior needs reusable loop-local boundary extraction without physics behavior drift.
3. `CS-0106` remains a system-contract requirement: loop ownership/indexing and aggregate outputs must exist with N=1 compatibility preserved for downstream consumers.

## 5) Stage A Exit Decision
Stage A root-cause confirmation is complete for `CS-0080`, `CS-0105`, and `CS-0106`. Stage B design freeze authorized.
