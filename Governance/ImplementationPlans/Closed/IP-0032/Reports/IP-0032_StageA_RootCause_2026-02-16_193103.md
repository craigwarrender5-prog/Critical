# IP-0032 Stage A Root Cause Confirmation (2026-02-16_193103)

## 1) Scope
`IP-0032` Stage A scope (`DP-0010`):
- `CS-0097`
- `CS-0083`
- `CS-0060`
- `CS-0058`

## 2) Baseline and Gate Record
- Baseline rollback anchor commit: `6b0a1587bb7c7e81224c937f8f4afc9bc9d4c2d3`
- Baseline commit timestamp: `2026-02-16T20:36:42+01:00`
- Baseline push status: pushed to `origin/working` before execution start.
- Working tree state at Stage A start: clean.

## 3) Evidence Reviewed

## 4) Root-Cause Confirmation

### CS-0097
- Confirmed class: governance lifecycle integrity debt.
- Confirmation detail: prior closure/governance workflows left cross-registry parity defects and stale historical references requiring governance-only remediation.
- Stage A disposition: reproducible and scoped to governance artifacts only.

### CS-0083
- Confirmed class: documentation authority conflict.
- Confirmation detail: conflicting numeric RCP-heat authorities exist in baseline documentation with no explicit precedence rule, preventing single-source conformance.
- Stage A disposition: root-cause confirmed; requires explicit authority decision artifact in Stage B.

### CS-0060
- Confirmed class: constants-file responsibility violation.
- Confirmation detail: runtime executable logic exists in constants partials, conflicting with GOLD constraints for constants ownership.
- Stage A disposition: root-cause confirmed; remediation requires extraction/re-homing strategy in Stage B.

### CS-0058
- Confirmed class: lifecycle ownership leakage.
- Confirmation detail: first-time initialization path guarded/executed within UPDATE instead of deterministic pre-update initialization lifecycle.
- Stage A disposition: root-cause confirmed; remediation requires deterministic init boundary contract.

## 5) Dependency Map (Intra-IP)
1. `CS-0097` first (governance integrity baseline for closure confidence).
2. `CS-0083` second (authority decision for downstream constant normalization).
3. `CS-0060` third (constants-path refactor aligned to selected authority model).
4. `CS-0058` fourth (startup lifecycle hardening on corrected ownership model).

## 6) Stage A Exit Decision
Stage A root-cause confirmation is complete for all four in-scope CS items.

Authorized transition to Stage B:
- Define explicit authority precedence and conformance targets (`CS-0083`).
- Define extraction plan and ownership map for constants runtime logic (`CS-0060`).
- Define deterministic initialization contract and acceptance assertions (`CS-0058`).
- Define governance parity completion criteria and audit checks (`CS-0097`).
