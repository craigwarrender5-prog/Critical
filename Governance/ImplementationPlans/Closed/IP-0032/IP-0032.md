# IP-0032 - DP-0010 - Governance Preconditions and Authority Normalization

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0010 - Project Governance`
- IP Status: `CLOSED`
- Scope Basis: `READY_FOR_FIX` CS assigned to DP-0010 for Wave 0 preconditions.
- Sequence intent: establish governance and authority preconditions before downstream remediation IPs.
- Baseline gate: satisfied (pre-existing work committed/pushed before execution start).
- Current stage: `Closed - Approval Recorded`

## 2) Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0097 | Remediate Legacy Governance Integrity Failures Identified by Global Gate Validation | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0083 | Baseline A contains conflicting numeric authority for RCP heat, preventing single-source conformance. | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0060 | PlantConstants partials execute runtime calculation logic (GOLD constants-file fail gate) | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0058 | HZP subsystem initialization occurs in UPDATE path (lazy init phase leakage) | HIGH | CLOSED |

## 3) Intra-IP Sequencing
1. CS-0097: resolve cross-register parity and governance integrity debt.
2. CS-0083: declare and document single numeric authority for RCP heat.
3. CS-0060: remove runtime logic from constants partial path.
4. CS-0058: enforce startup/init ownership outside UPDATE leakage paths.

## 4) Downstream Dependencies Unblocked
- Unblocks `IP-0036` (`CS-0080` authority alignment).
- Unblocks Wave 2 startup/protection validation reliability in `IP-0035`.
- Reduces rework risk for Wave 4 governance hardening (`IP-0038`).

## 5) Stage Gates
- Stage A: confirm current signatures and exact call paths.
- Stage B: design and authority selection freeze.
- Stage C: controlled remediation.
- Stage D: DP-level validation of governance/authority outcomes.
- Stage E: system regression and non-regression confirmation.

## 6) Exit Criteria
- Governance parity checks pass across register/index/archive.
- Single authoritative RCP heat basis is documented and referenced.
- Constants path is data-only (no runtime behavior decisions).
- Init path authority is deterministic and not lazily leaked into UPDATE.
