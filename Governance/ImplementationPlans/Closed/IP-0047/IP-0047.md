# IP-0047 - DP-0010 - Project Governance Hardening and Standards Enforcement Rescheduled Execution

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0010 - Project Governance`
- IP Status: `CLOSED`
- Included CS count: `10`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0099 | Governance Hardening v3 - Mandatory CS Lifecycle, Persistent Domain Model, Dependency Hierarchy Enforcement, Cross-Domain Protocol, CS Persistence Rule, and IP Revision Control | CRITICAL | CLOSED (Gate A) |
| CS-0084 | Project-owned C# files do not uniformly meet required GOLD header metadata fields. | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0090 | Project-level changelog governance is missing, weakening traceability for module changes and deviations. | HIGH | CLOSED |
| CS-0063 | Simulation-facing files exceed GOLD hard size limits without documented waiver | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0085 | File-level change history is incomplete or missing for audited modules. | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0086 | Public API surfaces lack consistent XML documentation coverage. | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0087 | Several modules exceed responsible file-size/separation-of-concerns limits, increasing coupling risk. | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0089 | Validation modules remain in global namespace, conflicting with namespace-folder convention standardization. | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0100 | Update PROJECT_TREE.md to define Scenario System and Modular RCS target structure | MEDIUM | CLOSED |
| CS-0070 | HeatupSimEngine header lacks mandatory GOLD C01 sections (SOURCES and UNITS) | LOW | CLOSED |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- `CS-0099` is prerequisite governance baseline for remaining DP-0010 remediation ordering.
- `CS-0084`, `CS-0085`, and `CS-0070` establish metadata/header standards before API/namespace and structure remediations.

### Blocking relationships
- `CS-0099` blocks constitutional compliance closeout for all other governance CS in this IP.
- `CS-0100` should complete before architecture-facing modular work in downstream DPs to avoid path ambiguity.
- `CS-0084`/`CS-0085` block clean enforcement of `CS-0086` and `CS-0089`.

### Shared files/systems
- `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md`
- `Documentation/PROJECT_TREE.md`
- Governance register and changelog artifacts
- Broad codebase header and namespace surfaces

### Interference risk between fixes
- High cross-cutting interference risk from wide file-touch footprint.
- High coordination risk if downstream domain plans execute while governance standards are still shifting.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. `CS-0099` governance baseline hardening.
2. `CS-0100` structural authority update (`PROJECT_TREE.md`) and freeze.
3. `CS-0070`, `CS-0084`, `CS-0085`, `CS-0090`.
4. `CS-0086`, `CS-0089`.
5. `CS-0063`, `CS-0087`.

Critical path: `CS-0099 -> CS-0100 -> (CS-0070, CS-0084, CS-0085, CS-0090) -> (CS-0086, CS-0089) -> (CS-0063, CS-0087)`

## 5) Enforcement Gates and Exit Criteria
### Gate A - Governance Baseline PASS (`CS-0099`)
- Constitution lifecycle and IP controls are present and unambiguous in authoritative governance artifacts.
- Active register schema/status usage is compliant (`READY`, `INVESTIGATING`, `BLOCKED`, `DEFERRED`, `OPEN` only for active).
- Evidence required:
  - Governance diff summary artifact
  - Register/schema validation output artifact
- Gate execution status:
  - `PASS` recorded in `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0047/Reports/IP-0047_GateA_GovernanceBaseline.md`

### Gate B - Structural Authority PASS (`CS-0100`)
- `Documentation/PROJECT_TREE.md` reflects approved target structure before namespace/placement cleanup starts.
- No downstream structural updates proceed until this document is reviewed and frozen for the wave.
- Evidence required:
  - `PROJECT_TREE` before/after diff artifact
  - Structural freeze checkpoint note

### Gate C - Metadata/Changelog PASS (`CS-0070`, `CS-0084`, `CS-0085`, `CS-0090`)
- Header metadata audit reports zero required-field omissions in scoped files.
- Change-history/changelog governance artifacts exist and map to changed modules.
- Evidence required:
  - Header audit report
  - Changelog linkage report

### Gate D - Namespace/API PASS (`CS-0086`, `CS-0089`)
- Namespace audit report confirms no in-scope legacy global-namespace violations remain.
- API XML documentation audit confirms required coverage threshold and no missing required API docs in scope.
- Evidence required:
  - Namespace migration audit report
  - API XML documentation audit report

### Gate E - Structural Maintainability PASS (`CS-0063`, `CS-0087`)
- File-size/separation audit confirms scoped violations are remediated or formally waived with justification.
- Evidence required:
  - File-size/separation audit report
  - Waiver ledger (if any), with explicit approvals

### IP Closeout PASS
- All included CS have deterministic closure disposition with evidence cross-references.
- Stage/closeout package is complete and reproducible.

## 6) Containment and Change-Control Strategy
- Batch execution by gate only; do not mix Gate C/D/E edits in a single commit batch.
- Branch isolation: use dedicated `ip-0047` execution branch; no unrelated changes permitted.
- File-touch freeze by wave:
  - During Gate C, freeze namespace and structural refactor edits.
  - During Gate D, freeze metadata/changelog edits except blocker fixes.
- Partial-commit restriction: each commit must map to one CS or one gate checkpoint; mixed-CS commits are not allowed.
- Pre-merge safety checks required for each gate:
  - scoped diff review
  - register/schema validation
  - required audit artifact generation

## 7) Required Evidence Artifacts
Store under `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0047/Reports/`:
- `IP-0047_GateA_GovernanceBaseline.md`
- `IP-0047_GateB_ProjectTreeFreeze.md`
- `IP-0047_GateC_MetadataChangelogAudit.md`
- `IP-0047_GateD_NamespaceApiAudit.md`
- `IP-0047_GateE_StructuralMaintainabilityAudit.md`
- `IP-0047_Closeout_Traceability.md`

Each artifact must include:
- date/time
- author
- scoped file set
- objective pass/fail result
- supporting command outputs or audit tables

## 8) Cross-Domain Notes
- Domain owner remains `DP-0010`.
- This IP sets standards consumed by all execution IPs; no implicit cross-domain implementation changes are permitted.

## 9) Closeout Disposition
- `CS-0099` closed via Gate A evidence (`PASS`).
- Gate B executed and closed `CS-0100`.
- Gate C executed and closed `CS-0070`, `CS-0084`, `CS-0085`, `CS-0090`.
- Gate D executed and closed `CS-0086`, `CS-0089`.
- Gate E executed and closed `CS-0063`, `CS-0087` under documented waiver controls.
- All included CS are now `CLOSED` with linked evidence and closeout traceability.

## 10) Revision History

|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Initial successor plan draft from rescheduled IP-0038 plus newly ready CS-0100. | Prepare executable DP-0010 governance plan with explicit critical path and dependency hierarchy. |
| v0.2 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Added objective enforcement gates, containment strategy, required evidence artifacts, and moved CS-0100 to explicit early structural-freeze step. | Remove subjective closure risk and tighten execution safety for high cross-touch governance work. |
| v0.3 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Executed Gate A, added evidence report reference, and advanced plan status to in-progress. | Record deterministic Stage 1/Gate A execution and evidence linkage. |
| v0.4 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Closed IP as rescheduled after Gate A; added closeout disposition and traceability report reference. | User-approved closure of IP-0047 with unexecuted CS explicitly retained in READY lifecycle state. |
| v1.0 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Executed Gates B-E, added evidence artifacts, and finalized closeout with all remaining CS dispositioned CLOSED. | Complete full IP-0047 execution wave and formal closeout after reopen directive. |
