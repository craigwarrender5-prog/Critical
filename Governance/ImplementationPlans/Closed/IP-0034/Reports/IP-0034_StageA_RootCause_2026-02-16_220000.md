# IP-0034 Stage A Root Cause Confirmation (2026-02-16_220000)

## 1) Scope
`IP-0034` Stage A scope (`DP-0009`):
- `CS-0088`

## 2) Baseline and Gate Record
- Baseline rollback anchor commit: `d743b85d0f1501e36c14ee1ebda86516e08a1888`
- Baseline commit timestamp: `2026-02-16T21:54:41+01:00`
- Baseline push status: branch anchor available before Stage C execution.
- Working tree at Stage A start: non-clean (pre-existing unrelated governance moves preserved).

## 3) Evidence Reviewed
- `Technical_Documentation/Conformance_Audit_Report_2026-02-15.md:168`
- `Technical_Documentation/Conformance_Audit_Report_2026-02-15.md:174`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:1859`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:2015`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:2109`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs:2920`

## 4) Root-Cause Confirmation
1. F-010 identifies runtime warning calls in simulation-step hot paths where repeated condition failure can emit high-frequency string-formatted logs.
2. Confirmed high-frequency warning sites in the active step path:
- Regime 2 coupled non-convergence warning (`HeatupSimEngine.cs:1859`)
- Regime 3 coupled non-convergence warning (`HeatupSimEngine.cs:2015`)
- Regime 1 mass-audit drift warning (`HeatupSimEngine.cs:2109`)
- PBOC pairing warning (`HeatupSimEngine.cs:2920`)
3. The issue is signal-path policy, not physics logic: diagnostics are valid, but emit cadence is unconstrained in persistent fault windows.

## 5) Stage A Exit Decision
Stage A root-cause confirmation is complete for `CS-0088`. Stage B design freeze authorized.
