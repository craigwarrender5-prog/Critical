# IP-0055 Stage 1 Governance Restructure Report (2026-02-18 14:30 UTC)

- IP: `IP-0055`
- Stage: `1 - Governance Documentation Restructure (CS-0126)`
- Result: `PASS`

## Implemented Changes
1. Constitution upgraded from `v1.7.0.0` to `v1.8.0.0`:
- `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md`
2. Article III canonical locations updated to enforce CS-folder hierarchy and lifecycle movement:
- Pre-IP: `Governance/Issues/CS-XXXX/`
- Assigned to active IP: `Governance/ImplementationPlans/IP-XXXX <Domain Name>/CS-XXXX/`
- Closed IP bundle: `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-XXXX <Domain Name>/CS-XXXX/`
3. Forward-only migration policy documented in Constitution migration requirements:
- Legacy flat files remain grandfathered unless explicit migration scope is authorized.
4. IP-0055 execution state normalized from draft to active execution:
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/IP-0055 Project Governance/IP-0055.md`

## Validation Evidence
1. Constitution version header and effective date reflect `v1.8.0.0` on `2026-02-18`.
2. IP-0055 folder contains required CS subfolders:
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/IP-0055 Project Governance/CS-0124/`
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/IP-0055 Project Governance/CS-0126/`
3. Investigation artifacts present within IP-0055 CS folders:
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/IP-0055 Project Governance/CS-0124/Investigation_Report_2026-02-18_120000.md`
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/IP-0055 Project Governance/CS-0126/Investigation_Report_2026-02-18_140000.md`

## Stage Decision
- Stage 1 exit gate satisfied.
- Proceed to Stage 2 (CS-0124 Part A: physics-module partial extraction).
