## A) Scope Summary

This Implementation Plan addresses two governance improvements for the Critical Simulator project:

1. **CS-0126**: Restructure governance documentation trail with hierarchical CS-folder organization
2. **CS-0124**: Large file refactoring - partial class extraction for oversized modules

Both items are documentation/code hygiene improvements with no physics or runtime behavior changes.

---

## B) Included CS Items

| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status | Stage |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| CS-0126 | Restructure governance documentation trail with hierarchical CS-folder organization under Implementation Plans | MEDIUM | CLOSED | Stage 1 |
| CS-0124 | Large file refactoring analysis - multiple files exceed 50KB threshold | MEDIUM | CLOSED | Stage 2-4 |

---

## C) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis

### CS-0126: Governance Documentation Restructure

**Prerequisites:** None  
**Blocking Relationships:** None  
**Shared Files/Systems:**
- `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` (Article III amendment required)
- `Governance/Issues/` directory structure
- `Governance/ImplementationPlans/` directory structure

**Interference Risk:** LOW - Documentation-only change, no code impact

### CS-0124: Large File Refactoring

**Prerequisites:** None (independent of CS-0126)  
**Blocking Relationships:** None  
**Shared Files/Systems:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/SGMultiNodeThermal.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/CVCSController.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Physics/SolidPlantPressure.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/MultiScreenBuilder.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine*.cs`

**Interference Risk:** MEDIUM - Code changes require compilation validation

### Cross-CS Dependencies

```
CS-0126 ─────► None (independent)

CS-0124 ─────► None (independent)

No blocking dependencies between included CS items.
```

## D) Execution Order

### Stage 1: Governance Documentation Restructure (CS-0126)

**Objective:** Implement hierarchical CS-folder structure and amend Constitution
**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-02-18)

**Tasks:**
1. Update Constitution v1.7.0.0 → v1.8.0.0
   - Amend Article III Section 5 (Investigation artifacts)
   - Add migration requirements for folder structure
2. Document forward-only migration policy
3. Validate this IP (IP-0055) demonstrates the new structure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Constitution Article III reflects new folder hierarchy
- IP-0055 folder contains CS-0124/ and CS-0126/ subfolders
- New structure documented in migration requirements

**Exit Gate:** Constitution updated, folder structure validated

### Stage 2: Physics Module Refactoring (CS-0124 Part A)

- Physics outputs unchanged (baseline comparison)

**Exit Gate:** Physics modules compile, acceptance tests pass

### Stage 3: UI Module Refactoring (CS-0124 Part B)

**Objective:** Extract partial classes from UI builder modules
**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-02-18)

**Tasks:**
1. MultiScreenBuilder.cs extraction:
   - Create per-screen partial files
   - Maintain shared utilities in core file
2. OperatorScreenBuilder.cs assessment (monitor only if < 55KB)
3. Stage 3 completion evidence:
   - Report: `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0055 Project Governance/Reports/IP-0055_Stage3_UIRefactor_Complete_2026-02-18_172500.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All new files < 50KB
- Zero compilation errors
- Editor functionality preserved

**Exit Gate:** UI modules compile, editor tools functional

### Stage 4: Validation Module Assessment (CS-0124 Part C)

**Objective:** Assess and potentially refactor validation partials
**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-02-18)

**Tasks:**
1. Review HeatupSimEngine partial structure
2. Assess BubbleFormation.cs (97.6 KB) for further extraction
3. Assess Logging.cs (89.8 KB) for further extraction
4. Document waivers if extraction not practical
5. Stage 4 completion evidence:
   - Report: `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0055 Project Governance/Reports/IP-0055_Stage4_ValidationAssessment_2026-02-18_173500.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Files < 50KB OR documented waiver with justification
- Validation behavior unchanged

**Exit Gate:** All modules assessed, waivers documented

## E) Critical Path

```
Stage 1 (CS-0126) ────► Stage 2 (CS-0124 Physics) ────► Stage 3 (CS-0124 UI) ────► Stage 4 (CS-0124 Validation)
     │                        │                              │                           │
     │                        │                              │                           │
   [1 hour]                [2-3 hours]                   [1-2 hours]                 [1 hour]
```

**Total Estimated Duration:** 5-7 hours

**Critical Path Items:**
- Stage 1 must complete before IP closure (Constitution amendment)
- Stages 2-4 can be executed in sequence or parallel where files don't overlap

---

## F) Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Partial class compilation order issues | LOW | MEDIUM | Validate compilation after each extraction |
| Field visibility changes required | MEDIUM | LOW | Use `internal` visibility where needed |
| Physics behavior regression | LOW | HIGH | Run baseline comparison tests |
| Merge conflicts with active development | MEDIUM | LOW | Execute during stable window |
| Constitution amendment oversight | LOW | MEDIUM | Full document review before merge |

---

## G) Cross-Domain Documentation

### Impacted Domains

| Domain | Impact | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| DP-0010 (Project Governance) | PRIMARY | Owning domain for both CS items |
| DP-0003 (SG Secondary Physics) | SECONDARY | SGMultiNodeThermal.cs refactoring |
| DP-0004 (CVCS) | SECONDARY | CVCSController.cs refactoring |
| DP-0007 (Validation) | SECONDARY | HeatupSimEngine partials assessment |

### Cross-Domain Inclusion Requests

None required - all work falls within DP-0010 governance scope. File changes in other domain areas are structural only (no behavioral changes).

---

## H) Validation Plan

### Pre-Execution Baseline
1. Document current file sizes
2. Run full acceptance test suite
3. Capture physics output baseline (temperature, pressure, level at key milestones)

### Post-Stage Validation
- **Stage 1:** Constitution diff review, folder structure verification
- **Stage 2:** Compilation check, physics baseline comparison
- **Stage 3:** Compilation check, editor tool functional test
- **Stage 4:** Compilation check, validation suite execution

### Final Validation
1. All files < 50KB (or documented waiver)
2. Zero compilation errors
3. Acceptance tests pass
4. Physics outputs match pre-execution baseline
5. Constitution v1.8.0.0 committed
