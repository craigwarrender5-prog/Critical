# IP-0044 - DP-0006 - Plant Protection Startup Permissive and SG Alarm Rescheduled Execution

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0006 - Plant Protection & Limits`
- IP Status: `Draft`
- Included CS count: `2`

## 2) Included CS Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0079 | RCP startup permissive is configured below documented minimum startup pressure requirements. | HIGH | READY |
| CS-0010 | No SG secondary pressure alarm | LOW | READY |

## 3) Dependency Hierarchy Analysis
### Prerequisite CS items
- `CS-0079` is prerequisite for `CS-0010`.

### Blocking relationships
- `CS-0079` blocks final acceptance of `CS-0010` because alarm setpoint validity depends on permissive/pressure contract correctness.
- External blocker: startup baseline and hold-release behavior must be frozen by `IP-0048`.

### Shared files/systems
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Validation/HeatupSimEngine.Init.cs`
- Startup permissive/plant protection signal paths and SG pressure alarm pathways.

### Interference risk between fixes
- Moderate risk of threshold churn if startup baseline changes concurrently.
- Moderate risk of alarm chatter regressions if SG pressure response work (`DP-0011`) is modified in parallel.

## 4) Execution Order and Critical Path
1. Implement and validate `CS-0079`.
2. Implement and validate `CS-0010`.

Critical path: `CS-0079 -> CS-0010`

## 5) Cross-Domain Notes
- Domain owner remains `DP-0006`.
- If DP-0011 or DP-0012 runtime behavior changes are required during execution, open Cross-Domain Inclusion Request before implementation.

## 6) Revision History
| Revision | Date | Author | Summary of Changes | Reason for Amendment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-02-17 | Codex | Initial successor plan draft from rescheduled IP-0035 scope. | Prepare executable DP-0006 plan with constitutional dependency hierarchy and sequencing. |
