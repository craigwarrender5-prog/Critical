## 4) Root-Cause Confirmation
1. `CS-0079` root cause was confirmed from authoritative issue evidence: startup permissive configuration had been governed as below documented minimum startup pressure requirement.
2. `CS-0010` root cause was confirmed as missing SG secondary pressure high alarm coverage in the primary alarm surface.
3. Both defects are control/annunciation contract gaps and do not require new physics regime creation.
