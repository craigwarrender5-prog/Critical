# IP-0036 - DP-0001 - RCP Heat Authority Alignment

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0001 - Primary Thermodynamics`
- IP Status: `CLOSED`
- Scope Basis: Wave 2 primary constants alignment after authority freeze.
- Current stage: `Closed`

## 2) Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0080 | RCP heat-input constants do not align with the cited cold-water heatup reference basis. | HIGH | CLOSED |

## 3) Execution Strategy
1. Stage A confirm active mismatch between selected authority and runtime constants.
2. Stage B lock final authority source and acceptance bounds.
3. Stage C align constants and consuming paths.
4. Stage D validate startup heat trajectory and domain-level criteria.
5. Stage E verify system non-regression.

## 4) External Dependencies
- Hard dependency on `IP-0032` authority/constant governance preconditions.
- Consumes telemetry clarity from `IP-0033`.

## 5) Exit Criteria
- Runtime RCP heat constants and references are aligned to a single authoritative basis.
- Validation evidence confirms physically and procedurally consistent startup behavior.
