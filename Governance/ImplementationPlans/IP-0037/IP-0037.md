# IP-0037 - DP-0011 - SG Startup Boundary and Pressure Response Remediation

## 1) Governance Header
- DP Reference: `DP-0011 - Steam Generator Secondary Physics`
- IP Status: `Draft`
- Scope Basis: Wave 3 SG startup remediation after Wave 2 baseline freeze.

## 2) Scope
| CS ID | Title | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS-0082 | SG startup boundary behavior is modeled isolated where references indicate steam-line warmup/open-path behavior. | HIGH | READY_FOR_FIX |
| CS-0078 | SG secondary pressure response does not begin at RCP circulation onset; rise is delayed until near-boiling | HIGH | READY_FOR_FIX |
| CS-0057 | SG startup draining contract at ~200F is not wired into runtime execution path | HIGH | READY_FOR_FIX |

## 3) Intra-IP Sequencing
1. CS-0082 first (boundary behavior model and instrumentation basis).
2. CS-0078 second (pressure response correction using corrected boundary behavior).
3. CS-0057 third (draining contract wiring validated on corrected startup path).

## 4) External Dependencies
- Depends on `IP-0035` for plant-protection startup threshold/alarm alignment.
- Depends on `IP-0036` for primary heat-input authority baseline.
- Should consume signal integrity from `IP-0033`.

## 5) Stage Gates
- Stage A: isolate startup boundary and pressure-response signatures.
- Stage B: freeze SG startup acceptance criteria and scenario windows.
- Stage C: remediate boundary, response, and draining contract behavior.
- Stage D: validate per-CS acceptance and integrated SG startup behavior.
- Stage E: run full system non-regression checks.

## 6) Exit Criteria
- SG startup boundary model behavior matches selected documented operating intent.
- SG pressure responds at expected startup timing.
- Draining contract wiring is active and validated in startup scenarios.
