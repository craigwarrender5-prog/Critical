        "Scope note: this CS starts at first non-zero RCP circulation (ramp onset) after bubble precondition and does not require full pump ramp completion. Bubble formation/draining timing defects are tracked separately under existing bubble-phase CS items and are not duplicated here.",
        "In latest build run, with RCPs at 4/4 and SG top node increasing from 109.53F to 216.90F (13.25hr -> 16.00hr), SG pressure remains only 17.1 -> 17.8 psia; pressure rise accelerates only near 234.95F/255.31F around boiling transition.",
        "Acceptance criteria: SG secondary pressure response must begin at circulation onset (first non-zero RCP state) and continue directionally upward through warmup, even if initial increments are small, without remaining floor-clamped until near-boiling transition."
