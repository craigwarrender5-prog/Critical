- IP: `IP-0056`
- DP: `DP-0008`

## Scope Result
1. `CS-0127`: Implemented and closed.
2. `CS-0118`: Implemented and closed.
3. `CS-0121`: Implemented and closed.

## Exit Criteria Check
1. DP-0008 dashboard backlog umbrella scope (`CS-0127`) transitioned to closed disposition: `PASS`.
2. Subordinate telemetry/visual backlog items (`CS-0118`, `CS-0121`) transitioned to closed disposition: `PASS`.
3. Active-register parity updated (`issue_register.json` active-only projection no longer contains DP-0008 items): `PASS`.

## Disposition
`CLOSE IP-0056` as `IMPLEMENTED` (non-standard closeout path requested by user; closure recorded through authoritative issue-index dispositions).
