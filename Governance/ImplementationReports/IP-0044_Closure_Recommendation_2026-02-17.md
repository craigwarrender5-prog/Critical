# IP-0044 Closure Recommendation (2026-02-17)

- IP: `IP-0044`
- DP: `DP-0006`
- Final Stage E evidence: `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0044/Reports/IP-0044_StageE_SystemRegression_2026-02-17_183900.md`
- Execution complete timestamp reference: `2026-02-17T17:29:00Z`

## Scope Result
Scoped implementation is complete for:
1. `CS-0079`
2. `CS-0010`

## Exit Criteria Check
1. RCP startup permissive authority remains aligned to documented minimum startup pressure (`400 psig`): `PASS`.
2. SG secondary pressure alarm remains implemented with deterministic set/clear behavior and annunciation visibility: `PASS`.
3. Stage A-E artifacts, closeout traceability package, and register/index/archive closure transaction are complete and internally consistent: `PASS`.
4. Build verification completed with `0` errors: `PASS`.

## Residual Risk
1. Validation evidence in this terminal session is static-path plus compile verification; Unity Editor runtime replay remains recommended for dynamic trip/clear timing confirmation.

## Recommendation
`CLOSE IP-0044`.

## Closure Decision
`APPROVED` - IP-0044 is closed as of `2026-02-17T17:29:00Z`.
