# IP-0045 Closure Recommendation (2026-02-17)

- IP: `IP-0045`
- DP: `DP-0001`
- Final Stage E evidence: `Governance/ImplementationPlans/Closed/IP-0045/Reports/IP-0045_StageE_SystemRegression_2026-02-17_185400.md`
- Execution complete timestamp reference: `2026-02-17T17:44:00Z`
- Closure approved timestamp reference: `2026-02-17T17:55:48Z`

## Scope Result
Scoped implementation is complete for:
1. `CS-0080`
2. `CS-0105`
3. `CS-0106`

## Exit Criteria Check
1. RCP heat authority baseline remains aligned to frozen constants and consuming paths: `PASS`.
2. Reusable modular RCS loop boundary scaffolding is implemented and prefab-path ready: `PASS`.
3. N-loop manager/aggregator contract with N=1 compatibility semantics is implemented: `PASS`.
4. Stage A-E artifacts are complete and compile verification completed with `0` errors: `PASS`.

## Residual Risk
1. Evidence in this terminal session is static-path plus compile validation; Unity Editor runtime scenario replay for dynamic behavior parity remains recommended.

## Recommendation
`CLOSE IP-0045`.

## Closure Decision
`APPROVED` - IP-0045 is closed as of `2026-02-17T17:55:48Z`.
