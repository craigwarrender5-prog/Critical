## Residual Risk Statement
- Cross-domain watchlist runners for DP-0001, DP-0002, DP-0003, and DP-0005 were intentionally not executed in this cycle to enforce strict DP-0004-only scope. Residual risk is recorded as low-to-moderate and accepted for DP-0004 closeout.

## Final Recommendation
- Close `IP-0022` and close `DP-0004`.
