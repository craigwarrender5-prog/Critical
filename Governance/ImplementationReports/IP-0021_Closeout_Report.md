## Residual Risk Statement
- Cross-domain watchlist runners for DP-0001/DP-0003/DP-0005 were intentionally not executed in this cycle to honor strict DP-0002-only scope. Residual risk is recorded as low-to-moderate and accepted for DP-0002 closeout.

## Final Recommendation
- Close `IP-0021` and close `DP-0002`.
