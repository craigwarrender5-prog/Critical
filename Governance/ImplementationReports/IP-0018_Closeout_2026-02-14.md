# IP-0018 Closeout Report (2026-02-14)

## Objective and Scope
- Objective: Close IP-0018 for DP-0003 by validating and documenting completion of CS-0009, CS-0017, CS-0019, CS-0020, and CS-0054.
- Scope: Governance and validation closeout only for the authorized IP-0018 package chain; no new CS scope was introduced.

## Package Change Summary
- Package 1 (`d9c9f12`): Deterministic SG telemetry baseline established for IP-0018 validation runs.
- Package 2 (`1f4e99d`): SG startup pressurize/hold state behavior implemented for CS-0017.
- Package 3 (`cb8c557`): Secondary Tsat/pressure progression corrections implemented for CS-0019.
- Package 4 (`0bff5de`): Dynamic secondary response corrections implemented for CS-0020.
- Package 5 (`aef7611`): SG energy validation telemetry and threshold checks implemented for CS-0009.
- Package 6 (`90aeec4`): IP-0018 Stage E threshold runner and evidence generation implemented.
- Package 7 (`9806096`): CS-0054 flatline follow-up fix implemented (state-aware windowing of pressure flatline criterion).

## Final CS PASS/FAIL Table
| CS ID | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `CS-0009` | PASS | `Updates/Issues/IP-0018_StageE_Validation_2026-02-14_191442.md` |
| `CS-0017` | PASS | `Updates/Issues/IP-0018_StageE_Validation_2026-02-14_191442.md` |
| `CS-0019` | PASS | `Updates/Issues/IP-0018_StageE_Validation_2026-02-14_191442.md` |
| `CS-0020` | PASS | `Updates/Issues/IP-0018_StageE_Validation_2026-02-14_191442.md` |
| `CS-0054` | PASS | `Updates/Issues/IP-0018_StageE_Validation_2026-02-14_191442.md` |

## Stage E Failure Root Cause (CS-0054)
- Root cause: Scope/windowing artifact in Stage E flatline evaluation, where `OPEN_PREHEAT` intervals were included in flatline counting.
- Outcome: Follow-up fix (`9806096`) constrained flatline evaluation to the intended active isolated-heatup window, yielding `stageE_DynamicPressureFlatline3Count = 0` in final Stage E evidence.

## Constraint Compliance Confirmation
- Stage E thresholds were not loosened or modified during closeout.
- No implementation scope expansion beyond CS-0009, CS-0017, CS-0019, CS-0020, and CS-0054.
- No additional implementation plans were created.
