# Orphan ID Follow-up Triage (2026-02-18)

## Scope
- Triage orphan investigation IDs: `CS-0112`, `CS-0113`, `CS-0114`, `CS-0118`.
- Determine per-ID disposition: register as active lifecycle item or formally retire.

## Disposition Decisions
1. `CS-0112` -> **FORMALLY RETIRED**
- Register action: Added to `issue_index.json` as `CLOSED`, `ARCHIVE`, `resolution_type: CLOSE_NO_CODE`.
- Rationale: Findings conflict with later pressurizer-policy investigations and do not provide a uniquely actionable scope beyond split audits in `CS-0113`/`CS-0114` and closed policy work (`CS-0109`).

2. `CS-0113` -> **REGISTERED (ACTIVE)**
- Register action: Added to `issue_index.json` and `issue_register.json` as `READY`, assigned `DP-0012`.
- Scope: PlantConstants pressurizer parameter/comment/source-governance gaps.

3. `CS-0114` -> **REGISTERED (ACTIVE)**
- Register action: Added to `issue_index.json` and `issue_register.json` as `READY`, assigned `DP-0012`.
- Scope: PressurizerPhysics derivative-fidelity and engineering-basis traceability gaps.

4. `CS-0118` -> **REGISTERED (ACTIVE)**
- Register action: Added to `issue_index.json` and `issue_register.json` as `READY`, assigned `DP-0008`.
- Scope: Validation dashboard condenser/feedwater telemetry coverage gap.

## Consistency Updates Applied
- Updated `Governance/DomainPlans/DP-0012 - Pressurizer & Startup Control.md` to reflect reopened active scope (`CS-0113`, `CS-0114`).
- Updated `Governance/DomainPlans/DP-0008 - Operator Interface & Scenarios.md` to include `CS-0118`.
- Updated register timestamps/counts.

## Post-Triage Integrity Result
- No orphan gaps remain in `CS-0001..CS-0124`.
- Active set and index parity restored for triaged IDs.
