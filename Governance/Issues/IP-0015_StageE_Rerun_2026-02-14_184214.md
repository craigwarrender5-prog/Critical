- Startup window samples: 1382
- Post-boiling samples: 777
- First boiling time: 15.84 hr
- First isolated time: 14.17 hr
- First pressure rise above floor: 15.84 hr
- Max SG pressure during isolated boiling: 150.61 psia
- Max steam inventory during isolated boiling: 271.88 lb
- Min net plant heat in startup window: 4.4514 MW
