- Timestamp: 2026-02-14 14:05:41
- Scenario: Full cold startup heat-up (MainScene, deterministic StepSimulation loop)
- Steps executed: 6480
- Final sim time: 18.00 hr
- Final T_rcs: 401.61 F
- Final SG pressure: 155.35 psia

## Metrics
- Isolated boiling samples: 196
- Startup window samples: 1385
- Post-boiling samples: 780
- First boiling time: 15.84 hr
- First isolated time: 14.16 hr
- First pressure rise above floor: 15.84 hr
- Max SG pressure during isolated boiling: 154.20 psia
- Max steam inventory during isolated boiling: 279.19 lb
- Min net plant heat in startup window: 4.4518 MW
- Min RCS heat rate post-boiling: 14.3152 F/hr
