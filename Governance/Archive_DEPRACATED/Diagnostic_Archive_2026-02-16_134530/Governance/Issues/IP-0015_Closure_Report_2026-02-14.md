- IP ID: `IP-0015`
- DP ID: `DP-0003`
- Closure mode: Governance/Validation finalization
- Closure date: `2026-02-14`

## Authoritative Evidence
- `Updates/Issues/IP-0015_StageE_Rerun_2026-02-14_164359.md`
- `Updates/Issues/IP-0015_StageE_Rerun_2026-02-14_164456.md`

## Stage E PASS Summary
Both rerun artifacts report identical PASS outcomes:
- Overall Stage E result: `PASS`
- SG pressure departs atmospheric floor during isolated boiling: `PASS`
- Steam inventory accumulates while isolated: `PASS`
- Net plant heat remains positive during startup segment: `PASS`
- RCS heat-up no longer stalls post-boiling: `PASS`
- No new conservation regressions: `PASS`

Key metrics (both runs):
- Final SG pressure: `151.47 psia`
- Max steam inventory during isolated boiling: `271.88 lb`
- Min net plant heat in startup window: `4.4514 MW`
- Min RCS heat rate post-boiling: `14.1943 F/hr`
- Max mass error observed: `92.50 lbm`

## Scope Closure Confirmation
IP-0015 scoped CS closed:
- `CS-0014`
- `CS-0015`
- `CS-0016`
- `CS-0018`
- `CS-0047`
- `CS-0048`

## Conservation Non-Regression Statement
No new conservation regression was introduced by IP-0015 closure evidence. Both reruns explicitly pass the conservation non-regression criterion.

## SG Validation Objective Statement
SG startup validation objectives defined for IP-0015 are satisfied based on the Stage E rerun evidence set and are accepted for formal closure.

## Final Declaration
IP-0015 is formally declared `CLOSED (Stage E PASS - 2026-02-14)`.
