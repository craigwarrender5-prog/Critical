- Timestamp: 2026-02-14 14:04:05
- Scenario: Full cold startup heat-up (MainScene, deterministic StepSimulation loop)
- Steps executed: 6480
- Final sim time: 18.00 hr
- Final T_rcs: 401.52 F
- Final SG pressure: 154.37 psia

## Metrics
- Isolated boiling samples: 194
- Startup window samples: 1384
- Post-boiling samples: 780
- First boiling time: 15.84 hr
- First isolated time: 14.16 hr
- First pressure rise above floor: 15.84 hr
- Max SG pressure during isolated boiling: 153.43 psia
- Max steam inventory during isolated boiling: 277.34 lb
- Min net plant heat in startup window: 4.4082 MW
- Min RCS heat rate post-boiling: 14.1724 F/hr
