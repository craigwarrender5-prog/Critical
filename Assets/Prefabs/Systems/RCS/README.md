## Modular RCS Prefab Boundary

This folder is the governance-frozen prefab root for modular RCS loop assets.

- CS-0105 scope reserves this path for reusable `RCSLoop` prefab boundaries.
- CS-0106 uses this root for future N-loop prefab composition.
- Current IP-0045 implementation ships runtime contracts and manager scaffolding in:
  - `Assets/Scripts/Systems/RCS/`

No prefab assets are required for N=1 compatibility validation in this stage.
