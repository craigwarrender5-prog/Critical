# CRITICAL: Master the Atom — Refactoring Plan v2

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Version:** Plan v2 (supersedes v1)
**Scope:** GOLD standard elevation for all modules, separation of concerns, deduplication, legacy cleanup
**Constraint:** Maintain full functionality. All renames tracked with reference updates.

## 1. What Is GOLD Standard?

Based on analysis of the existing GOLD modules in this project, GOLD standard means:

### GOLD Standard Criteria

| # | Criterion | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| G1 | **Single Responsibility** | Module does one thing. Physics modules own physics. Coordinators coordinate. GUI renders. |
| G2 | **Documented Header** | File header states: purpose, physics basis, NRC/industry sources, units, and architecture role |
| G3 | **No Inline Physics in Engines** | Simulation engines delegate to physics modules; they never calculate physics inline |
| G4 | **Result Structs** | Physics modules return typed result structs, not modify engine state directly |
| G5 | **Constants from PlantConstants** | Module-specific constants are acceptable only when domain-isolated (e.g., safety system setpoints). Shared constants come from PlantConstants. |
| G6 | **Validated Parameters** | All NRC/Westinghouse-sourced values cite their source document |
| G7 | **Namespace Compliance** | Physics in Critical.Physics, Controllers in Critical.Controllers, UI in Critical.UI |
| G8 | **Manageable Size** | Target: < 30 KB per file. Hard limit: 40 KB. Files above this are split using partial class. |
| G9 | **No Dead Code** | No obsolete methods, unused variables, or commented-out blocks |
| G10 | **No Duplication** | Shared logic extracted to common utilities. Constants defined once. |
