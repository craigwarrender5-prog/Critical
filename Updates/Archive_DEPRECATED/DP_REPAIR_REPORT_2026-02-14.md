## D) Article VII Domain-Grouping Intent Confirmation
- Exactly one DP exists per unique Domain value in Issue Registry.
- Every CS has a Domain and Assigned DP ID.
- Assigned IP IDs remain blank across the registry.
- Single-issue DPs are explicitly justified as domain-isolated.
- Domain-grouping intent is satisfied under current registry domain definitions.
