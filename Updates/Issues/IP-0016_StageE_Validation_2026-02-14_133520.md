# IP-0016 Stage E Validation - 2026-02-14 13:35:20

- IP ID: `IP-0016`
- Domain Plan: `DP-0005 - Mass & Energy Conservation`
- Run method: `Critical.Validation.StageERunner.RunStageE` (Unity batchmode)
- Unity evidence artifact: `Updates/Issues/IP-0015_StageE_Rerun_2026-02-14_133517.md`
- Heatup report: `HeatupLogs/Heatup_Report_20260214_133520.txt`
- Unity execution log: `HeatupLogs/Unity_StageE_IP0016_final.log`

## Overall Result
- **Stage E Result: FAIL**
- Reason: conservation gate failure (`max mass error = 57911.69 lbm`, final `massError_lbm = 43553.0 lbm`)

## Mandatory Gate Evaluation (IP-0016)
- Stage E overall = PASS: **FAIL**
- Conservation = PASS: **FAIL** (`43553.0 lbm > 500 lbm`)
- No regime-transition discontinuity > epsilon_mass: **PASS** (`assert delta = 0.000 lbm`, epsilon `50.0 lbm`)
- Interval thresholds satisfied: **FAIL** (first fail at `Heatup_Interval_035_8.50hr.txt`: `3668.7 lbm`, `0.397%`; limits are `500 lbm` and `0.05%`)
- Step-level divergence eliminated: **FAIL** (`max mass error observed = 57911.69 lbm`)
- RTCC telemetry present at regime boundaries: **PASS** (`Transition Count = 1`, `Assertion Failures = 0`)

RTCC LAST TRANSITION:
  Name:             SOLID_TO_TWO_PHASE
  Authority:        CANONICAL_SOLID -> CANONICAL_TWO_PHASE
  Pre Mass:           812909.6 lbm
  Reconstructed:      795405.6 lbm
  Raw Delta:        -17504.000 lbm
  Post Mass:          812909.6 lbm
  Assert Delta:          0.000 lbm
  Epsilon:                50.0 lbm
  Result:           PASS
```

## Transition-Adjacent Interval Evidence
- `HeatupLogs/Heatup_Interval_033_8.00hr.txt`: `Interval Conservation: PASS (48.6 lbm, 0.005%)`
- `HeatupLogs/Heatup_Interval_034_8.25hr.txt`: `Interval Conservation: PASS (56.8 lbm, 0.006%)`
- `HeatupLogs/Heatup_Interval_035_8.50hr.txt`: `Interval Conservation: FAIL (3668.7 lbm, 0.397%)`

## Long-Run Conservation Evidence
- Worst interval error in run: `HeatupLogs/Heatup_Interval_048_11.75hr.txt` -> `57616.1 lbm (6.234%)`
- Final report conservation summary (`HeatupLogs/Heatup_Report_20260214_133520.txt`):
  - `Conservation Error: 43553.0 lbm (4.729%)`
  - `RTCC telemetry present: PASS`
  - `RTCC assertion failures: PASS (0)`

## Non-Regression Reconfirmation (CS-0001/0002/0003/0005/0008/0004/0013)
- Reconfirmed as **implemented and active** in runtime telemetry for this run:
  - Canonical authority handoff telemetry present (`CANONICAL_SOLID -> CANONICAL_TWO_PHASE`)
  - Boundary accumulators populated (`Total Charging/Letdown/Seal/CBO` non-zero in report)
  - Runtime conservation guardrails executed with no runtime assertion throw
  - Session-level RTCC counters reset and incremented deterministically (`Transition Count = 1`)
- Note: Stage E remains failed due residual plant-wide divergence (CS-0050 scope), not transition assert failure.

## Required Failure Handling
Per IP-0016 failure gate requirements:
- No CS closed in this run.
- New CS logged for post-RTCC residual divergence class: `CS-0052`.

## Conclusion
- CS-0051 transition discontinuity class is corrected at the regime boundary.
- DP-0005 closure remains blocked by unresolved long-duration conservation divergence (CS-0050 + CS-0052).
