- Timestamp: 2026-02-14 14:07:31
- Scenario: Full cold startup heat-up (MainScene, deterministic StepSimulation loop)
- Steps executed: 6480
- Final sim time: 18.00 hr
- Final T_rcs: 400.13 F
- Final SG pressure: 152.38 psia

## Metrics
- Isolated boiling samples: 199
- Startup window samples: 1382
- Post-boiling samples: 777
- First boiling time: 15.84 hr
- First isolated time: 14.17 hr
- First pressure rise above floor: 15.84 hr
- Max SG pressure during isolated boiling: 152.38 psia
- Max steam inventory during isolated boiling: 273.82 lb
- Min net plant heat in startup window: 4.3196 MW
