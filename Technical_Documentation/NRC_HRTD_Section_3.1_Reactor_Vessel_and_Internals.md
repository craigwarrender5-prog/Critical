## 3.1.1 Introduction

The reactor vessel and its internals contain the heat source for the nuclear steam supply system. Key functions:

- **Fuel cladding** provides the first barrier to fission product release
- **Internals packages** support and align fuel assemblies
- **Flow paths** direct coolant to remove heat and distribute it to coolant loops

- Cylindrical vessel with welded hemispherical bottom head
- Removable, flanged and gasketed, hemispherical upper head
- Contains reactor core, support structures, control rods, and flow-directing members
